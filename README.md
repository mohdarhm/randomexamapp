# randomexamapp
[OVERVIEW]

This webapp aims to tackle unethical copying in an examination by completely randomising the question paper using a central database. the question can have various flags such as difficulty levels and hence can be fetched in a manner that obeys certain constraints (say out of 15 questions 3 are very hard, rest are normal, etc).
